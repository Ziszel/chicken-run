# Board

This repository contains the code to Board. A small snowboarding style game created in Unity.

Guide your snowboarder down the mountain, remembering to keep in mind:

- Time is against you! Rush down as fast as possible!
- Take out those horrible shiny bollards for score!
- Keep your balance, and try to do flips as you get airtime!
- Collect the golden cube for style points!
- A well timed boost is your friend...

Created over the course of two weeks, enjoy!
