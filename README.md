# Board

This repository contains the code to Board. A small snowboarding style game created in Unity.

Guide your snowboarder down the mountain, remembering to keep in mind:

- Time is against you! Rush down as fast as possible!
- Take out those horrible shiny bollards for score!
- Keep your balance, and try to do flips as you get airtime!
- Collect the golden cube for style points!
- Collect the red cube for even more style points!
- A well timed boost is your friend...
- Different characters have different abilities
- Score accumulates over level plays... don't worry about one bad run!

Created over the course of five weeks, enjoy!
